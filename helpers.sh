# MSYS/Git-Bash converts POSIX-style paths (/repo.feature) passed as arguments
# to native Windows programs (jq, wt, herdr) into Windows paths
# (C:/Program Files/Git/repo.feature). jq --arg values like /repo.feature become
# unusable, and wt -C /path would receive a mangled path. MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1
# disables that conversion for this script and its children. git and cp are MSYS
# programs and are unaffected. Set here (helpers.sh) and in config.sh so every
# script that sources either is covered, including tests that source helpers.sh
# directly without config.sh.

# Resolve the real worktrunk binary (`wt`). On Windows, bare `wt` on PATH resolves
# to the Windows Terminal app-execution alias (wt.exe in WindowsApps), which
# shadows the real worktrunk binary. Every direct `wt` call in the plugin goes
# through this resolver so it finds worktrunk, not Windows Terminal.
#
# Search order:
#   1. RUNTIME_WORKTRUNK_BIN env var (absolute path to the binary).
#   2. Known install locations (winget package dir, WinGet Links, Program Files).
#   3. `wt` on PATH, but only if it is NOT the Windows Terminal alias — detected
#      by `wt --version` printing `wt v` (worktrunk prints `wt v<version>`;
#      Windows Terminal prints nothing and exits 0 or opens a window).
#
# Tab mode is the exception: the line typed into the user's interactive shell
# stays bare `wt` so worktrunk's own shell integration (the `wt` function, not
# the binary) runs and cd's the shell into the worktree. That path does not call
# this resolver.
